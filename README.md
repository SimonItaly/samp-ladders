# ladders.inc

Create simple ascend / descend points in your levels where players can move directly up or down. The animation isn't great and looks a bit stupid, but it's the one I thought looked best!

## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install Southclaws/samp-ladders
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <ladders>
```

## Testing

To test, simply run the package:

```bash
sampctl package run
```

And connect to `localhost:7777` to test.
